# CyberPatriot Resources

This repository is an ongoing collection of resources that I have used during the CyberPatriot competition. While there will not be any practice images attached due to their file size, I will add several links to them in this README.<br />

There are several checklists, manuals and helpful pointers in this repository, but use at your own discretion. If you are currently competing in CyberPatriot, DO NOT use the CyberPAtriot-specific resources as that is a violation of the rules. Good luck!
